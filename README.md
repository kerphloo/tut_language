This repository contains the final source code of [Creating a Programming Language in Rust](https://kerphloo.gorm.online/tutorial.pdf).

This interprets a very basic postfix-notated language supporting variables and signed integers, as well as some basic arithmetical operators.

`cargo run test` will evaluate the "test" file which includes some sample code to test the interpreter.

This project was created for an ICS4U assignment.
